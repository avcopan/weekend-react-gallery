## Installation

1. Create a database named `react_gallery` and use the queries in `database.sql` to create the gallery table.
2. If your database requires username and password access, use the environment variables `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` to set these values. *If you put these values in a `.env` file inside this repository, they will be read automatically.*
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Click on the body of an image to toggle between the image and its description.
2. Click on the heart icon to "like" an image.
